                    This article explores the potential impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity, a critical area in society. Quantum computing process 
                    information in ways that classical computers cannot. Instead of using traditional bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use qubits, which 
                    can exist in multiple states simultaneously. One application of quantum computing is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which secures 
                    communications by detecting disruptions such as hacking attempts. QKD ensures that any attempt to intercept data will immediately alter 
                    the quantum state. The article also compares quantum computers to classical ones, explaining how quantum machines operate differently, 
                    and why they are better suited for tasks involving massive amounts of data and require high security. The recent development of the QKD 
                    demonstrates how quantum computing can address key challenges in data security, such as interference and signal loss over long distances. 
                    As quantum technology continues to advance, it has the potential to reduce hacking risks and enhance cybersecurity.

                   Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics, the study of particles on a subatomic scale, to enhance safety in computing. 
                    This advancement in technology has significant implications for cybersecurity, a vital field in today’s digital society. Cybersecurity 
                    involves protecting sensitive data and networks from digital attacks (Kaspersky, 2019). Due to the world’s increasing dependency on 
                    technology, cybersecurity has become more important than ever. Any damage or attack could result in financial loss for countries or national 
                    security (Tunggal, 2019).

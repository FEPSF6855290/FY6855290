                    This article explores the potential impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity, a critical area in society. Quantum computing process 
                    information in ways that classical computers cannot. Instead of using traditional bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use qubits, which 
                    can exist in multiple states simultaneously. One application of quantum computing is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which secures 
                    communications by detecting disruptions such as hacking attempts. QKD ensures that any attempt to intercept data will immediately alter 
                    the quantum state. The article also compares quantum computers to classical ones, explaining how quantum machines operate differently, 
                    and why they are better suited for tasks involving massive amounts of data and require high security. The recent development of the QKD 
                    demonstrates how quantum computing can address key challenges in data security, such as interference and signal loss over long distances. 
                    As quantum technology continues to advance, it has the potential to reduce hacking risks and enhance cybersecurity.

                    Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics, the study of particles on a subatomic scale, to enhance safety in computing. 
                    This advancement in technology has significant implications for cybersecurity, a vital field in today’s digital society. Cybersecurity 
                    involves protecting sensitive data and networks from digital attacks <a  href=”https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cyber-security”>Kaspersky (2019).</a> Due to the world’s increasing dependency on

   <h3 id=”Analysis and discussion”> How Quantum computers work?</h3>
                     
                    
      
                     Quantum computers use qubits instead of bits to store more information than classical computers. Quantum particles are manipulated and 
                     measured to form qubits. These qubits are kept exceptionally cold to prevent inaccuracies due to decoherence, which occurs when quantum 
                     particles decay, collapse, and lose their quantum coherence <a  href=”https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221”>Zewe, A. (2023).</a> There are various types of qubits, each suited for specific tasks. 
                     For example, superconducting qubits formed from superconducting circuits within a quantum computer, creating entanglement. These qubits are 
                     manipulated using electromagnetic pulses to control the electric charge, or phase difference across areas of the circuit 
                     <a  href=”https://doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2021.1963429”>Wang, J., Shen, L. and Zhou, W. (2021).</a> Another type of qubit is photons, used to send quantum information through optical fibre cables. This system 
                     involves placing a quantum key transmitter at one end of a fibre optic cable and a quantum key receiver at the other. A key is sent into the 
                     transmitter, where it creates an invisible link with another quantum object. The key is then placed in a light pulse, which travels through the 
                     cable to the receiver, where it is converted back into a key. This system's benefit for cybersecurity lies in its ability to detect disruptions. 
                     If a hacker attempts to intercept or tamper with the light pulse, the quantum properties of the key are immediately altered. This technology, 
                     known as Quantum Key Distribution, offers a level of security that is unattainable with classical encryption. As technology increasingly shapes 
                     society, ensuring secure communications and protecting sensitive data is more critical than ever.

        <h3 id=”Analysis and discussion”>Quantum computers vs Classical computers</h3>
                     
                    

                     Quantum and classical computers share some similarities such as both typically having chips, circuits and logic gates <a  href=”https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-computing-computers”>Caltech (2023).</a> They 
                     operate based on algorithms, which are sets of instructions for solving a problem or tasks <a  href=”https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithm.asp">Downey, L. (2019).</a> However, they differ in how they store 
                     information. Classical computers store information as bits with discrete states, either 0 or 1 <a  href=”https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">Schneider, J. and Smalley, I. (2024).</a> Quantum computers, 
                     on the other hand, use qubits, capable of existing in multiple states simultaneously until measured; superposition <a  href=”https://www.ijnrd.org/papers/IJNRD2305721.pdf">Hossain, D. (2023).</a> Qubits can be 
                     0, 1, or both at the same time. Additionally, qubits can become entangled, meaning that the state of one qubit directly influences the state of the 
                     other, regardless of the distance between them. Superposition and entanglement are key concepts that give quantum computers capabilities beyond 
                     classical computing. Quantum processors handle calculations differently from classical computers. Instead of solving each step of a complex 
                     problem one at a time, quantum circuits can process vast amounts of data simultaneously, making them far more efficient for preventing hacking.

                     In 2022, the first Quantum Key Distribution network was created, demonstrating that ability to detect and defend against potential threats is 
                     possible. This study displays an 800 Gbps quantum secured optical channel, highlighting the combination of high speed data transmission with 
                     QKD technology. The research proved that QKD can function effectively in real world scenarios, addressing major challenges, such as signal 
                     interference (hacking) and distance-related losses. <a  href=”https://doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/acd1a8">Pistoia, M., Amer, O., Behera, M.R., Dolphin, J.A., Dynes, J.F., John, B.,

                     Figure 1 provides a simplified overview of the test system used in the experiments. It illustrates how both the data channel 
                     (carrying high-speed traffic) and the quantum channel (used for encryption keys) were combined onto a single optical fibre. The data channels were 
                     generated using Ciena Wave server systems, designed to handle large amounts of traffic. The quantum channel uses quantum mechanics to securely 
                     generate encryption keys. These keys were shared between the two system components, labelled as “Alice” and “Bob”.

                     Figure 2 displays the test results over different distances, from 70 km to 100 km. It shows two lines: the Secure Key Rate, which measures how 
                     quickly encryption keys can be created, and the Quantum Bit Error Rate, which indicates errors in the quantum channel. According to Figure 3, 
                     at 70 km, the SKR was measured at 66.16 kbps, revealing a secure high speed data channel. However, as the distance increased, the SKR dropped 
                     significantly to 30.5 kbps at 80 km, 12 kbps at 90 km, 2 kbps at 100 km. This decline occurred because longer distances caused more signal loss, 
                     reducing the number of photons reaching the receiver and making it more difficult to generate secure keys. On the other hand, the QBER remained 
                     constant and low at most distances, indicating that the quantum channel stayed efficient and reliable despite the distance. These data show how 
                     QKD can be integrated into modern technology and is not just a theoretical concept <a  href=”https://doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/acd1a8">Pistoia, M., Amer, O., Behera, M.R., Dolphin, J.A., Dynes, J.F., John, B.,

       <h3 id=”Analysis and discussion”>Conclusion</h3>
                     
                     
                     Overall, this article highlights the potential of quantum computing and its impacts on cybersecurity and hacking. Quantum computers use qubits, 
                     unlike classical computers, which rely on bits. This major difference gives each type of computer unique properties, making them better suited 
                     for different tasks. The research into QKD illustrates the importance of further study in quantum computing to stay ahead of evolving threats and 
                     preserve trust in digital systems.
